About Whoosh
============

Whoosh is a fast, featureful full-text indexing and searching library
implemented in pure Python. Programmers can use it to easily add search
functionality to their applications and websites. Every part of how Whoosh
works can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly.

Some of Whoosh's features include:

* Pythonic API.
* Pure-Python. No compilation or binary packages needed, no mysterious crashes.
* Fielded indexing and search.
* Fast indexing and retrieval -- faster than any other pure-Python, scoring,
  full-text search solution I know of.
* Pluggable scoring algorithm (including BM25F), text analysis, storage,
  posting format, etc.
* Powerful query language.
* Pure Python spell-checker (as far as I know, the only one). 

Whoosh might be useful in the following circumstances:

* Anywhere a pure-Python solution is desirable to avoid having to build/compile
  native libraries (or force users to build/compile them).
* As a research platform (at least for programmers that find Python easier to
  read and work with than Java ;)
* When an easy-to-use Pythonic interface is more important to you than raw
  speed. 

Whoosh was created by Matt Chaput and is maintained currently by the Sygil-Dev Organization. It was originally created for use in the online help system of Side Effects Software's 3D animation software Houdini. Side Effects Software Inc. graciously agreed to open-source the code.
